### About Us
**Övobu Invest** is a student-run investment fund affiliated with the **Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)**. The fund is owned and managed by students with a passion for finance and investment.

Our vision is clear: to give students the opportunity to learn investment management through practice, not just theory. By managing real capital, we create a unique learning arena where the consequences are real, and the motivation is high.
